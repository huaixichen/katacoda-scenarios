In this step, we will use pxctl to inspect the volume

### Step: Inspect the Portworx volume

Portworx ships with a [pxctl](https://docs.portworx.com/control/status.html) command line that can be used to manage Portworx.

Below we will use pxctl to inspect the underlying volume for our PVC.

```
VOL=`kubectl get pvc | grep px-shared-pvc | awk '{print $3}'`
PX_POD=$(kubectl get pods -l name=portworx -n kube-system -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
kubectl exec -it $PX_POD -n kube-system -- /opt/pwx/bin/pxctl volume inspect ${VOL}
```{{execute T1}}

Make the following observations in the volume list
* `Status` indicates the volume is attached and shows the node on which it is attached. For shared volumes, this is the transaction coordinator node which all other nodes will go through to write the data.
* `HA` shows the number of configured replicas for this volume (shared volumes can be replicated of course, you can try it by modifying the storage class in step 2)
* `Shared` shows if the volume is shared
* `IO Priority` shows the relative priority of this volume's IO (high, medium, or low)

Now that we have our shared volumes created and mounted into all three nginx containers, let's proceed to write some data into the html folder of nginx and see how it gets read by all three containers.
