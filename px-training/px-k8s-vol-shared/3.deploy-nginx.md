In this step, we will deploy the nginx application using the `PersistentVolumeClaim` created before.

### Step deploy 3 instances of nginx
Take a look at the yaml:
```cat deploy-webapps.yaml```{{execute T1}}

Observe the `volumeMounts` and `volumes` sections where we mount the PVC.

Now use kubectl to deploy nginx.
```
kubectl create -f deploy-webapps.yaml
```{{execute T1}}

### Step: Verify nginx pods are ready

Run the below command and wait till all three nginx pods are in ready state.
```
watch kubectl get pods -l group=webapp -o wide
```{{execute T1}}

When all three pods are in Running state then then hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c and clear the screen. Be patient, if it's staying in Pending state for a while it's because it has to fetch the docker image on each node.
